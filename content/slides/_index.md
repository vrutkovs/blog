* [How Red Hat builds containers](
  https://vrutkovs.github.io/slides-how-redhat-builds-containers/)

  DevConf 2018, Brno CZ

  This talk describes problems and challenges when a lot of images need to be built, tested and tracked in a large organization. The Red Hat's solution to these problems are Atomic Reactor and OSBS - OpenShift Build System - and tight integration with Koji and other pieces of release pipeline.
