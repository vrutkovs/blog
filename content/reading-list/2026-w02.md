* [‘Will The AI Bubble Finally Burst’ And Other 2026 Predictions](https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-ai-bubble-2026-predictions/)

  AI is a bubble – one whose futuristic sheen deflects attention from a core of hot air.
  Anyone with sense recognizes this. But will it finally burst this year? Unfortunately, we have our
  doubts.

* [Fear is not advocacy](https://antonz.org/ai-advocacy/)

  AI advocates are often using fear-mongering and shaming tactics, rather than inspiring
  interest, to push developers into early adoption of AI. However, it's perfectly acceptable to be
  a late adopter, as this approach is safe, reasonable, and allows developers to absorb AI practices
  naturally without early bugs.

* [To those who fired or didn't hire tech writers because of AI](https://passo.uno/letter-those-who-fired-tech-writers-ai/)

  Hey you, yes, you, who are thinking about not hiring a technical writer this year or,
  worse, erased one or more technical writing positions last year because of AI. You, who are buying into
  the promise of docs entirely authored by LLMs without expert oversight or guidance. You, who unloaded
  the weight of docs on your devs’ shoulders, as if it was a trivial chore.You are making a big mistake.
  But you can still undo the damage.

* [Anthropic invests $1.5 million in the Python Software Foundation and open source security](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/12/anthropic-invests-in-python.html?m=1)

  Anthropic has committed $1.5 million over two years to the Python Software Foundation (PSF) to
  significantly enhance Python ecosystem security, focusing on CPython and PyPI. This investment will fund
  projects for automated proactive package review and malware detection.

* [Rethinking Helix](https://asta.boserup.eu/forest/rethinking-helix/)

  Neovim and Helix embody fundamentally different editing
  philosophies. Neovim is a modal, verb-object editor focused on immediate, cursor-based text
  manipulation, fostering "flow." Helix, a "two-tier" editor, prioritizes "first-class selections" (an
  explicit anchored cursor), requiring users to set up a selection before acting on it.

* [Stop using MySQL in 2026, it is not true open source](https://optimizedbyotto.com/post/reasons-to-stop-using-mysql/)

  Users are strongly encouraged to migrate from MySQL to MariaDB or other truly open-source database
  solutions by 2026. It critiques Oracle's stewardship of MySQL, citing declining development, technical
  deterioration (performance regressions, upgrade struggles), a lack of transparent open-source practices,
  and significant security concerns.

* [The Zurich protocol](https://werd.io/the-zurich-protocol/)

  A fictional piece describing a future where a newsroom, anticipating government raids and
  censorship, implements the 'Zurich protocol.' When authorities attack, seeking to shut down operations
  and expose sources, the protocol activates a remote kill switch, encrypts data, and mirrors all content
  to secure servers in Switzerland and IPFS.
