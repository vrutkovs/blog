* [The lines have been drawn](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-lines-have-been-drawn)

  Silicon Valley must decide which side it's on. Executions by ICE in 2026 signify the rise of systematized state terror, supported by government lies and Silicon Valley's complicity. Tech workers must recognize the gravity of the situation, cease aiding the "architecture of authoritarianism," and actively engage in resistance and mutual aid.

* [On the smokescreen of AGI, and fighting for workers in the age of Trump and the tech oligarchy](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/on-the-smokescreen-of-agi-and-fighting)

  Artificial General Intelligence acts as a marketing smokescreen used by tech elites to push deregulation and obscure real-world harms like job displacement and environmental costs. Democratic oversight of technology and worker solidarity are essential against extractive AI companies.

* [Kubernetes Remote Code Execution Via Nodes/Proxy GET Permission](https://grahamhelton.com/blog/nodes-proxy-rce)

  An authorization bypass in Kubernetes RBAC allows the `nodes/proxy GET` permission to execute commands in any Pod. The vulnerability stems from the Kubelet incorrectly mapping WebSocket handshakes to the `GET` verb, bypassing `CREATE` checks.
