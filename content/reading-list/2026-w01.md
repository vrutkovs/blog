  As the year draws to an end now is a good time to review where we are with Europe’s cloud situation, and what has been achieved.

You could get your phone light and fumble around, or you could spend many hours integrating smart lighting into the sides of your wardrobe to give you some soft illumination while you search for the clothes you probably should have laid out the evening before. Naturally, I chose option B, and here’s how I did it.

  Wikipedia says “An IBM PC compatible is any personal computer that is hardware- and software-compatible with the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) and its subsequent models”. But what does this actually mean? The obvious literal interpretation is for a device to be PC compatible, all software originally written for the IBM 5150 must run on it. Is this a reasonable definition? Is it one that any modern hardware can meet?
