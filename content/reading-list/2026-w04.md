* [Stop using natural language interfaces - Tidepool Heavy Industries](https://tidepool.leaflet.pub/3mcbegnuf2k2i)

  Natural language is a wonderful interface, but just because we suddenly can doesn't mean we always should.

* [The Insecure Evangelism of LLM Maximalists](https://lewiscampbell.tech/blog/260114.html)

  "Agentic LLM" coding is inefficient and requires excessive oversight, serving more as a digital clerk than a productivity booster. "LLM maximalists" aggressively promote this technology, often attributing resistance to insecurity. However, this evangelism often projects the maximalists' own insecurity and programming inadequacy rather than genuine technological advancement.

* [On FLOSS and training LLMs - Chronicae Novis Rebus](https://chronicles.mad-scientist.club/tales/on-floss-and-training-llms/)

  Generative AI training on FLOSS code might be legally permissible due to inadequate laws, but it remains fundamentally unethical. Creators should deny AI companies access by avoiding platforms like GitHub and defending against crawlers. Communities should shame and shun AI proponents who disrespect the ethos of open source.

* [Building a local agent for email classification using distil labs & n8n](https://www.distillabs.ai/blog/building-a-local-agent-for-email-classification-using-n8n-distil-labs)

  Build a local, privacy-preserving email classification agent using n8n and distil labs. Fine-tune a small model for custom email labels, deploy it locally via Ollama, and integrate it with n8n to automatically classify Gmail emails without sending private data to cloud LLMs.

* [Anthropic made a big mistake](https://archaeologist.dev/artifacts/anthropic)

  Anthropic closed a loophole allowing access to Claude Pro/Max subscriptions via third-party coding agents like OpenCode, causing significant customer backlash. This move destroys goodwill and hands a competitive advantage to OpenAI, which quickly capitalized by officially supporting its own Codex subscriptions with OpenCode.

* [half-shot.uk | Please label your AI](https://half-shot.uk/blog/please-label-your-ai/)

  A personal aversion to AI and LLMs contrasts with a childhood love for computers, viewing the current trend as stifling genuine creative joy. The lack of disclosure for AI-generated content leads to deception and negatively impacts Free Software with low-effort contributions. Users must label AI-generated content to allow others the choice to engage with it.

* [Fly’s new Sprites.dev addresses both developer sandboxes and API sandboxes at the same time](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/9/sprites-dev/)

  Fly.io's new product, Sprites.dev, offers stateful sandbox environments with checkpoint and restore capabilities. It tackles two problems: providing secure development environments for coding agents and offering a robust API for running untrusted code safely.

* [On Programming with Agents - Zed Blog](https://zed.dev/blog/on-programming-with-agents)

  Agents handle typing so we can focus on thinking.

* [What Happened To WebAssembly](https://emnudge.dev/blog/what-happened-to-webassembly/)

  WebAssembly (Wasm) sees widespread, though often transparent, usage in applications like Godot, Figma, and Cloudflare Workers. As a secure, portable, low-level language, it serves as an efficient compilation target for many languages. Its strong security model and embeddability make it crucial for providing performant and secure runtime environments.

* [The Hobbyist Maintainer Economic Gravity Well](https://www.softwaremaxims.com/blog/hobbyist-gravity-well)

  Hobbyist open-source maintainers struggle to transition to paid, full-time work on their projects. Achieving a stable, livable income through donations or short-term grants is nearly impossible. Hobbyist maintainership acts as an "economic gravity well" requiring substantial, long-term, and unconditional funding to escape.

* [Selectively Disabling HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 - Mark McBride](https://markmcb.com/web/selectively_disabling_http_1/)

  Selectively disable HTTP/1.X access in Nginx after enabling HTTP/3 to reduce bad traffic. Use the `map` directive to identify HTTP/1.X requests and block assumed bad agents while allowing known good ones. This approach improves security while maintaining compatibility for legitimate bots and command-line users.

* [The Myth of the ThinkPad](https://innovintageblog.wordpress.com/2026/01/08/the-myth-of-the-thinkpad/)

  ThinkPads' celebrated attributes—repairability, durability, and affordability—derive from IBM and Lenovo's business model for corporate clients, not altruism. Design choices reduce service costs on corporate contracts. The perceived "cheapness" for hobbyists results from businesses discarding old laptops as e-waste, enabling low-cost resale.

* [HAM Radio Operators in Belarus Arrested, Face the Death Penalty](https://www.404media.co/ham-radio-operators-in-belarus-arrested-face-the-death-penalty/)

  The Belarusian government detains and threatens HAM radio operators with the death penalty, accusing them of espionage for "intercepting state secrets." Amateur radio becomes a target for authoritarian regimes due to its inherent resistance to censorship.

# Gaming Industry

* [Games Journalism Layoffs Hit Inverse, The Verge](https://aftermath.site/layoff-verge-inverse-gaming/)

  Games journalism faces layoffs as Bustle Digital Group's Inverse shuts down its gaming section and Vox-owned The Verge cuts coverage. Media companies continue to struggle with gaming content, signaling a challenging year for journalism.

* [A Game Doesn't Need To Be ‘By And For Fans’](https://aftermath.site/life-is-strange-reunion-fans/)

  Marketing *Life is Strange: Reunion* as "by and for fans" promises to give characters "the ending they deserve," but art should tell complex truths rather than merely satisfy fan desires. This trend across AAA franchises signals industry financial anxiety, leading to creative stagnation and a focus on marketability over artistic integrity.
