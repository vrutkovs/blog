I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) quite a lot and it's been super-helpful for organizing my thoughts and notes. Alongside some fleeting notes I also started using it as Read It Later tool instead of [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/). [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper) can also automatically save articles from the browser to Obsidian, adding tags and other metadata.

As a result I ended up with a large collection of articles, and so I decided to make this list public, in the hope that it might be useful or inspirational to others.
Here are the articles I've read this week:

  After a user signaled a performance issue in a Matrix client, we have added new tracing timers in the Matrix Rust SDK to spot the problem. Once found, we have fixed an SQL query improving the throughput from 19k to 251k events/sec, and the speed from 502ms to 39ms. Then after another creative patch, the throughput has been improved to 4.2M events/sec, and the speed to 2ms.
