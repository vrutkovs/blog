* [Premium: Mythbusters - AI Edition](https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-mythbusters/)

  The AI boom is a deceptive bubble where companies like NVIDIA artificially inflate demand for cloud compute, while media and analysts fail to critically examine the exaggerated claims and financial maneuvers, creating a "mythology" rather than a grounded reality.

* [20 Years of Digital Life, Gone in an Instant, thanks to Apple](https://hey.paris/posts/appleid/)

  A major brick-and-mortar store sold an Apple Gift Card that Apple seemingly took offence to, and locked out my entire Apple ID, effectively bricking my devices and my iCloud Account, Apple Developer ID, and everything associated with it, and I have no recourse. Here’s how Apple “Permanently” locked my Apple ID. I am writing this as a desperate measure.

* [Rethinking sudo with object capabilities](https://ariadne.space/2025/12/12/rethinking-sudo-with-object-capabilities.html)

  I hate sudo with a passion. It represents everything I find offensive about the modern Unix security model: like su, it must be a SUID binary to work it is monolithic: everything sudo does runs as root, there is no privilege separation it uses a non-declarative and non-hierarchical configuration format leading to forests of complex access-control policies and user errors due to lack of concision it supports plugins to extend the policy engine which run directly in the privileged SUID process  I could go on, but hopefully you get the point.
