* [The magical automated bathroom mirror · Eelviny](https://eelviny.me/posts/magic-mirror/)

  One of the greatest advantages of building your own DIY smarthome solutions, for me at least, is the ability to combine sensors and outputs in ways that would make no sense for a traditional manufacturer to implement. My bathroom mirror not only shines light onto my face when I’m brushing my teeth, but also makes sure my towel is nice and warm just after I take a shower. Let me show you how!

  It has been something in the back of my mind for more than a decade: how could railway passengers be better represented to campaign for improvements in international rail? Here's a piece I wrote in 2014 about the topic. And the issue very much came to a head in 2021 [...]

* [Your intellectual fly is open](https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2025/12/05/your-intellectual-fly-is-open/)

  Note: This was originally published as a LinkedIn post on November 11, 2025.I need to make a painful confession: somehow, LinkedIn has become an important social network to me. This isn’t necessarily due to LinkedIn’s sparkling competence, of course. To the contrary, LinkedIn is the Gerald Ford of social networks: the normal one that was left standing as the Richard Nixons and the Spiro Agnews of social media imploded around them. As with Gerald Ford, with LinkedIn we know that we’re getting something a bit clumsy and boring, but (as with post-Watergate America!), we’re also getting something that isn’t totally crooked — and that’s actually a bit of a relief.

* [Notes on OpenAI Kubernetes outage](https://ahmet.im/blog/openai-kubernetes-incident/)

  Last week, OpenAI has suffered a several hours long outage and published a detailed postmortem about it. Highly recommend reading it. These technical reports are usually a gold mine for all large-scale Kubernetes users, as we all go through similar set of reliability issues running Kubernetes in production.

* [Pitfalls reloading files from Kubernetes Secret & ConfigMap volumes](https://ahmet.im/blog/kubernetes-inotify/)

  Files on Kubernetes Secret and ConfigMap volumes work in peculiar and undocumented ways when it comes to watching changes to these files with the inotify(7) syscall. Your typical file watch that works outside Kubernetes might not work as you expect when you run the same progam on Kubernetes.On a normal filesystem, you start a watch on a file on disk with a library and expect to get an event like IN_MODIFY (file modified) or IN_CLOSE_WRITE (file opened for writing closed) when the file is changed. But these filesystem events never happen for files on Kubernetes Secret/ConfigMap volumes.

* [Why Kubernetes secrets take so long to update?](https://ahmet.im/blog/kubernetes-secret-volumes-delay/)

  I’ve recently done a Twitter poll and only 20% of the participants accurately predicted that it takes Kubernetes 60-90 seconds to propagate changes to Secrets and ConfigMaps on the mounted volumes. So I want to take you on a journey in the codebase on how the mechanics of these volume types work and why it takes so long.Before going on this journey, I would answer the poll “nearly instantly” (like the majority 40% did).

* [Kubernetes CRD generation pitfalls](https://ahmet.im/blog/crd-generation-pitfalls/)

  A quick code search query reveals at least 7,000 Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions in the open source corpus,1 most of which are likely generated with controller-gen —a tool that turns Go structs with comments-based markers into Kubernetes CRD manifests, which end up being custom APIs served by the Kubernetes API server.At LinkedIn, we develop our fair share of custom Kubernetes APIs and controllers to run workloads or manage infrastructure. In doing so, we rely on the custom resource machinery and controller-gen heavily to generate our CRDs.
