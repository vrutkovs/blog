* [The fate of “small” open source](https://nolanlawson.com/2025/11/16/the-fate-of-small-open-source/)

* [Running fedora coreos with incus](https://agnomi.net/posts/incus/fedora-coreos/)

  After using proxmox for years, incus is my new goto as hypervisor. As I like the lazyness of a self updating os, here is a way to work with Fedora CoreOS with incus. For those who don’t know, incus is a modern and secure system container and virtual machine manager. Fedora CoreOS (fcos) is an auto-updating, minimal-operating-system designed specifically for running containerized workloads with streamlined management via Ignition.

  We’re approaching the most ridiculous part of the AI bubble, with each day bringing us a new, disgraceful and weird headline. As I reported earlier in the week, OpenAI spent $12.4 billion on inference between 2024 and September 2025, and its revenue share with Microsoft heavily suggests it
